      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been in the back of my head to remake my blog and start posting again. I&amp;rsquo;ve had some great conversations about data science (and other things too!) but now have many thoughts to put down on paper/code.

The transition was very easy: copy-paste the .Rmd source files, reinstall packages for these files I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched in ages, and then run.</description>
