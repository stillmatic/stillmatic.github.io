      <description>Most fortunately it happens, that since reason is incapable of dispelling these clouds, nature herself suffices to that purpose, and cures me of this philosophical melancholy and delirium, either by relaxing this bent of mind, or by some avocation, and lively impression of my senses, which obliterate all these chimeras. I dine, I play a game of backgammon, I converse, and am merry with my friends; and when after three or four hours’ amusement, I would return to these speculations, they appear so cold, and strained, and ridiculous, that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any farther.</description>

      <description>I consume a lot of content so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to! Except these, you should consume these. This week covers some sports, startup news, and fashion.
 Read: Aaron Hernandez found to have severe CTE. Every season it becomes harder and harder to watch the NFL. I grew up on Patriots football (the lean Bledsoe years) and some of my fondest childhood memories are playing football with my friends. For a long time, I regretted running cross country instead of playing football - I really was fast!</description>

      <description>Introduction and Motivation The “Jaffe Wins Above Replacement Score”, aka JAWS, is a widely acknowledged sabermetric methodology for identifying Hall of Fame worthy players. It is defined, simply, as the average of the player’s career wins above replacement (WAR) with their ‘peak 7 year WAR,’ the total WAR achieved over their best 7 year stretch. This JAWS index is then compared to the average JAWS index of players already in the Hall of Fame, for their position.</description>
