      <description>Interviewed 16 October 2018. Lightly edited.
 
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in being profiled, drop me a line! I&amp;rsquo;m interested in speaking to early-mid career data scientists (hence, n=1 year).
What do you do?
I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist at KeyMe.
Our key value prop is in the tech, e.g. deep learning, which we use to scan keys and model what the output should be.
What did you study in school?</description>

      <description>Basically nothing I learned about data from school carried over when I got a data science job in industry.
The overwhelming of data which we collect in industrial data applications (by which, I do mean tech applications at scale) is log data. Most of what we work with in school (or outside of large tech companies) is not that. Typically, we&amp;rsquo;ll work with log data or metadata.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover what that data model looks like.</description>

      <description>Not all data science roles are created equal. Everyone will tell you that &amp;ldquo;data scientists&amp;rdquo; as a role play varying parts in different companies, but how can you choose between different teams?
Some heuristics I found useful: * % of employees that are data
* are people promoted from within * investments in data infra (eg how long does it take to get experiment results)
* data culture - who does data report to in management?</description>

      <description>Giving advice to be one of the hardest things somebody can do, and yet people ask for it at an alarming rate. Perhaps the best way to start, then, is with a reminder that life is hard and it&amp;rsquo;s okay to not know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. Your peers will pretend that they have everything figured out, and they will say as much, but know that you&amp;rsquo;re not seeing their own struggles.</description>
