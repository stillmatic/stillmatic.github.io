It is defined, simply, as the average of the player’s career wins above replacement (WAR) with their ‘peak 7 year WAR,’ the total WAR achieved over their best 7 year stretch. This JAWS index is then compared to the average JAWS index of players already in the Hall of Fame, for their position.</description></item></channel></rss>
