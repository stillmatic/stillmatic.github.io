      <description>Interviewed 16 October 2018. Lightly edited.
 
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in being profiled, drop me a line! I&amp;rsquo;m interested in speaking to early-mid career data scientists (hence, n=1 year).
What do you do?
I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist at KeyMe.
Our key value prop is in the tech, e.g. deep learning, which we use to scan keys and model what the output should be.
What did you study in school?</description>

      <description>Giving advice to be one of the hardest things somebody can do, and yet people ask for it at an alarming rate. Perhaps the best way to start, then, is with a reminder that life is hard and it&amp;rsquo;s okay to not know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. Your peers will pretend that they have everything figured out, and they will say as much, but know that you&amp;rsquo;re not seeing their own struggles.</description>
