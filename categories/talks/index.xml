      <description>The first story Ellen Pao told was about a law firm partner who stood outside a female lawyer&amp;rsquo;s office everyday after lunch, licking an ice cream cone while staring at her. Management&amp;rsquo;s response to these instances of sexism were invariably dismissive, e.g. “you should be flattered he&amp;rsquo;s interested in you,” or “it&amp;rsquo;s just one weird guy, but overall it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad, right?” The result is an environment that views sexism as the product of just one bad apple, but it&amp;rsquo;s instead the product of a bad system: one which condones and encourages “boys club” behavior.</description>
