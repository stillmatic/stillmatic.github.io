Everyone will tell you that &amp;ldquo;data scientists&amp;rdquo; as a role play varying parts in different companies, but how can you choose between different teams?
Some heuristics I found useful: * % of employees that are data
* are people promoted from within * investments in data infra (eg how long does it take to get experiment results)
* data culture - who does data report to in management?</description></item><item><title>Computing JAWS in R</title><link>/post/2016/08/19/jaws/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/2016/08/19/jaws/</guid><description>Introduction and Motivation The “Jaffe Wins Above Replacement Score”, aka JAWS, is a widely acknowledged sabermetric methodology for identifying Hall of Fame worthy players. It is defined, simply, as the average of the player’s career wins above replacement (WAR) with their ‘peak 7 year WAR,’ the total WAR achieved over their best 7 year stretch. This JAWS index is then compared to the average JAWS index of players already in the Hall of Fame, for their position.</description></item></channel></rss>
