I'm a data scientist, passionate about making data-informed decisions. Previously, I was a data science intern at [Airbnb](https://medium.com/@airbnbeng) and at [Expedia](http://blog.expedia.com/). 

Currently a senior at Wharton, majoring in statistics and finance. I am heavily involved with the statistics and [data science](https://github.com/wharton-data-analytics) communities on campus. Drop me a line if you're interested in throwing a data-related event at Penn!
