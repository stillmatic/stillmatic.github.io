<p>Interviewed 16 October 2018. Lightly edited.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in being profiled, drop me a line! I&rsquo;m interested in speaking to early-mid career data scientists (hence, n=1 year).</p>

<p><strong>What do you do?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-jiang-1bb247b4/">data scientist at KeyMe</a>.</p>

<p>Our key value prop is in the tech, e.g. deep learning, which we use to scan keys and model what the output should be.</p>

<p><strong>What did you study in school?</strong></p>

<p>I studied mechanical engineering and physics at Penn.</p>

<p><strong>What made you want to do data science?</strong></p>

<p>On suggestion of a friend, I applied to data science internship, which was code heavy but seemed more interesting than software. The problems were open-ended and cool: what&rsquo;s the problem, how can we solve the problem, flexible on which techniques to use to solve the problem.</p>

<p><strong>What did you expect to do as a data scientist?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>strategy</li>
<li>looking for trends</li>
<li>correlations that others weren&rsquo;t finding</li>
<li>predictive modeling</li>
<li>a lot of communicating results to management and arguing for a path.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What do you actually do?</strong></p>

<p>At first, I was the second hire on the team, with various transitions, that meant a lot of ETL / pipeline firefighting and small asks at first.</p>

<p>Now, it&rsquo;s more more like independent research, into some optimization models, but not a lot of ML.
Another big element is data evangelism, trying to bring people up to speed with data / share data more broadly. An example is the marketing analytics team:</p>

<ul>
<li>teaching SQL and aggregating data in a given way to help them</li>
<li>walking them through some data analysis questions</li>
<li>recognizing common pitfalls (e.g. causation vs correlation)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What tools do you use?</strong></p>

<p>Python, TensorFlow and Keras, Pandas/Numpy, FB Prophet, Redshift / SQL, Luigi for ETL, Tableau for visualization, Excel for everything which goes into PowerPoint</p>

<p><strong>Which teams or roles do you work the most with?</strong></p>

<p>Analytics is centralized - we work with marketing (campaign performance), engineering (data integrity, infrastructure), as well as ops (supply chain optimization, scheduling).</p>

<p>Information flows through analytics and it&rsquo;s hard to scale that to all teams - no single source of truth, need to define ground truth metrics and statistics, making sure everyone can make good decisions. A centralized approach is good in the short run.</p>

<p><strong>How did you have impact on the organization?</strong></p>

<p>Lot of different areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Revamped store selection model from third-party to in-house model.</li>
<li>Utilized new data sources and engineered new model which is 2x as good at predicting store usage.</li>
<li>Inventory utilization: each machine can only have a certain number of slots for key molds, which ones will have the most usage. We made this 50% better.</li>
<li>Refund rates are down drastically because of improvements in error rate, by understanding the purchase and refund funnel.</li>
<li>Dynamic pricing - increased core revenue by 25%.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How do you do experimentation?</strong></p>

<p>We typically set up user segmentation and assign users to a given experiment. This requires coordination with our front end engineers and product team.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the most important thing you learned?</strong></p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you find unless you convince others to take action on your results.</p>

<p><strong>Any other advice you have?</strong></p>

<p>The difficulty of data science code is overhyped: concepts are more difficult than most practice. In the real world, cutting-edge ML isn&rsquo;t that important, it&rsquo;s not Kaggle where we&rsquo;re going from 95→99%. It&rsquo;s more about problem solving and ability to independently learn and research. most peoples&rsquo; problems are not 100% unique, you can find research that&rsquo;s gets you 80% of the way there, your value is in knowing what to do and how to apply the existing research.</p>
