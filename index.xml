      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist at Quora, passionate about data, helping others, and eating noodles. At Quora, I am on the Ads data science team. Previously, I was a data science intern at Airbnb and at Expedia.
I graduated from Wharton, majoring in statistics and finance, where I was heavily involved with the statistics and data science communities on campus. I love to hike and cook, and am just as comfortable on top of a mountain as in my cramped kitchen - either way, there&amp;rsquo;s beer.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been in the back of my head to remake my blog and start posting again. I&amp;rsquo;ve had some great conversations about data science (and other things too!) but now have many thoughts to put down on paper/code.
My last iteration was based on Jekyll and I think had some early iteration of blogdown. This new iteration runs with blogdown and Hugo.
The transition was very easy: copy-paste the .Rmd source files, reinstall packages for these files I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched in ages, and then run.</description>

      <description>Introduction and Motivation The “Jaffe Wins Above Replacement Score”, aka JAWS, is a widely acknowledged sabermetric methodology for identifying Hall of Fame worthy players. It is defined, simply, as the average of the player’s career wins above replacement (WAR) with their ‘peak 7 year WAR,’ the total WAR achieved over their best 7 year stretch. This JAWS index is then compared to the average JAWS index of players already in the Hall of Fame, for their position.</description>
