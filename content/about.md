I'm a data scientist at [Quora](https://blog.quora.com/), passionate about data, helping others, and eating noodles. At Quora, I am on the [Ads](https://www.quora.com/business) data science team. Previously, I was a data science intern at [Airbnb](https://medium.com/@airbnbeng) and at [Expedia](http://blog.expedia.com/). 

I graduated from Wharton, majoring in statistics and finance, whereÂ I was heavily involved with the statistics and [data science](https://github.com/wharton-data-analytics) communities on campus. I love to hike and cook, and am just as comfortable on top of a mountain as in my cramped kitchen - either way, there's beer.

[Email](mailto:hua.christopher+gh@gmail.com) is a good way to get in contact with me - I typically respond during my Caltrain rides.
