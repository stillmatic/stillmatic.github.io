It's been in the back of my head to remake my blog and start posting again. I've had some great conversations about data science (and other things too!) but now have many thoughts to put down on paper/code.

My [last iteration](https://github.com/stillmatic/stillmatic.github.io/tree/f092f4e11a906ccaefcad758d7f56b8e5283e5dc) was based on Jekyll and I think had some early iteration of [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown). This new iteration runs with `blogdown` and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

The transition was very easy: copy-paste the `.Rmd` source files, reinstall packages for these files I haven't touched in ages, and then run. Hugo is also an excellent engine for a minimalist website, since flat files are quick to write and fast to serve.
