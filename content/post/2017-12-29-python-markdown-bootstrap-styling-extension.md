I wrote a small extension for the [Python-Markdown library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown) which adds [Bootstrap 4.0 styling](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) to images and tables generated by the generator, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/stillmatic/mdx_bootstrap).

Call this extension towards the end of your extension stack; it simply adds `class='img-fluid'` to `<img>` tags and `class='table table-striped'` to `<table>` tags. This extension probably isn't life-changing and it is probably also under-tested (in particular, there is no support for Python 2.7 which I don't use and don't intend to support). However, it goes a long way towards making images and tables behave nicely in sites using Bootstrap + Python-Markdown, both by respecting responsive layouts and by just looking nicer.
